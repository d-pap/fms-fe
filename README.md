# fms project

## Installation 

### 1. **Install Git and Node.js**
   - Ensure that both Git and Node.js are installed on your system.
   - You can check if they are installed by running these commands:
     ```bash
     git --version
     node --version
     npm --version
     ```

### 2. **Clone the GitHub Repository**
   - Open your terminal (VS Code terminal, Git Bash, or any terminal you prefer).
   - Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
   - Run the `git clone` command:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/d-pap/fms-fe.git
     ```

### 3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
   - After cloning, navigate to the project directory by running:
     ```bash
     cd repository-name
     ```

### 4. **Install Dependencies**
   - Once inside the project directory, install the project dependencies using npm (or yarn, if the project uses it). Run:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

### 5. **Run the React Program**
   - After the dependencies are installed, you can start the React development server by running:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```
   - This will start the React development server, and the application will open in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
